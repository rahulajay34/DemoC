## Testing Recommendations
1. Navigate to `/riders` to test rider form without validation
2. Navigate to `/bikes` to test bike form without validation  
3. Navigate to `/payments` to test payment form without validation
4. Navigate to `/assignments` to test assignment form without validation
5. Navigate to `/maintenance` to test maintenance form without validation

All forms now accept any input format while still indicating which fields are required with the (*) symbol.
